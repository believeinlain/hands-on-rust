# Hands-on Rust
Just bought the book [Hands-on Rust Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play by Herbert Wolverson](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/).

Apparently you can reformat your code to standard formatting simply by running `cargo fmt`. That's an awesome feature.

`&mut` is passed before a variable to let the function take ownership of the variable, but then return ownership when it returns. This is called "borrowing".
